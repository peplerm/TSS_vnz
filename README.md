# Differential RNA-sequencing analysis for identification of transcription start sites in *Streptomyces venezuelae* and annotation of potential ribonuclease targets

This project aims to use a variety of bioinformatic tools to identify and annotate transcription start sites in *S. venezuelae* at each developmental stage and integrate this information with available RNA-sequencing data from RNase III and RNase J mutants (Δrnc and Δrnj, respectively) with the ultimate goal of identifying potential targets of these ribonucleases.

The data analysis is split into three main parts 

1) Transcription start site identification by TSSAR (TSS_vnz)
2) RNA-sequencing analysis of RNase III and RNase J mutant strains (RNA_seq)
3) Integration of dRNA-sequencing and RNA-sequencing data (Integration)
